Corvus is an experiement in genetic programming. 

It creates a number of birds (BF virtual machines), each of which try to find food (f(x)), for a given problem (f). The birds reproduce upon finding enough food, or starve after trying too long.

To modify the function the corvus birds are trying to find, modify targetFunction in main.

VIRTUAL MACHINE:
Corvus uses a modified version of BF, in that input is always given by the x for a function.

So if I were to ',' for f(4), then ',' would store 4;

SPEED:
To find f(x) where f(x)=1, it takes apoximately...hold on...still waiting...
